.. py:class:: StandardScaler(copy=True, with_mean=True, with_std=True, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`dasf.transforms.base.Fit`, :py:obj:`dasf.transforms.base.FitTransform`, :py:obj:`dasf.transforms.base.TargeteredTransform`


   Standardize features by removing the mean and scaling to unit variance.

   The standard score of a sample `x` is calculated as:

       z = (x - u) / s

   where `u` is the mean of the training samples or zero if `with_mean=False`,
   and `s` is the standard deviation of the training samples or one if
   `with_std=False`.

   Centering and scaling happen independently on each feature by computing
   the relevant statistics on the samples in the training set. Mean and
   standard deviation are then stored to be used on later data using
   :meth:`transform`.

   Standardization of a dataset is a common requirement for many
   machine learning estimators: they might behave badly if the
   individual features do not more or less look like standard normally
   distributed data (e.g. Gaussian with 0 mean and unit variance).

   For instance many elements used in the objective function of
   a learning algorithm (such as the RBF kernel of Support Vector
   Machines or the L1 and L2 regularizers of linear models) assume that
   all features are centered around 0 and have variance in the same
   order. If a feature has a variance that is orders of magnitude larger
   than others, it might dominate the objective function and make the
   estimator unable to learn from other features correctly as expected.

   `StandardScaler` is sensitive to outliers, and the features may scale
   differently from each other in the presence of outliers. For an example
   visualization, refer to :ref:`Compare StandardScaler with other scalers
   <plot_all_scaling_standard_scaler_section>`.

   This scaler can also be applied to sparse CSR or CSC matrices by passing
   `with_mean=False` to avoid breaking the sparsity structure of the data.

   Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <preprocessing_scaler>`.

   Parameters
   ----------
   copy : bool, default=True
       If False, try to avoid a copy and do inplace scaling instead.
       This is not guaranteed to always work inplace; e.g. if the data is
       not a NumPy array or scipy.sparse CSR matrix, a copy may still be
       returned.

   with_mean : bool, default=True
       If True, center the data before scaling.
       This does not work (and will raise an exception) when attempted on
       sparse matrices, because centering them entails building a dense
       matrix which in common use cases is likely to be too large to fit in
       memory.

   with_std : bool, default=True
       If True, scale the data to unit variance (or equivalently,
       unit standard deviation).

   Attributes
   ----------
   scale_ : ndarray of shape (n_features,) or None
       Per feature relative scaling of the data to achieve zero mean and unit
       variance. Generally this is calculated using `np.sqrt(var_)`. If a
       variance is zero, we can't achieve unit variance, and the data is left
       as-is, giving a scaling factor of 1. `scale_` is equal to `None`
       when `with_std=False`.

       .. versionadded:: 0.17
          *scale_*

   mean_ : ndarray of shape (n_features,) or None
       The mean value for each feature in the training set.
       Equal to ``None`` when ``with_mean=False`` and ``with_std=False``.

   var_ : ndarray of shape (n_features,) or None
       The variance for each feature in the training set. Used to compute
       `scale_`. Equal to ``None`` when ``with_mean=False`` and
       ``with_std=False``.

   n_features_in_ : int
       Number of features seen during :term:`fit`.

       .. versionadded:: 0.24

   feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)
       Names of features seen during :term:`fit`. Defined only when `X`
       has feature names that are all strings.

       .. versionadded:: 1.0

   n_samples_seen_ : int or ndarray of shape (n_features,)
       The number of samples processed by the estimator for each feature.
       If there are no missing samples, the ``n_samples_seen`` will be an
       integer, otherwise it will be an array of dtype int. If
       `sample_weights` are used it will be a float (if no missing data)
       or an array of dtype float that sums the weights seen so far.
       Will be reset on new calls to fit, but increments across
       ``partial_fit`` calls.

   Constructor of the class StandardScaler.
