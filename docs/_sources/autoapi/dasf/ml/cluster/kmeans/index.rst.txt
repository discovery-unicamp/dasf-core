.. py:class:: KMeans(n_clusters=8, init=None, n_init=None, max_iter=300, tol=0.0001, verbose=0, random_state=None, copy_x=True, algorithm='full', oversampling_factor=2.0, n_jobs=1, init_max_iter=None, max_samples_per_batch=32768, precompute_distances='auto', output_type=None, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`dasf.ml.cluster.classifier.ClusterClassifier`

   K-Means clustering.

   Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <k_means>`.

   Parameters
   ----------

   n_clusters : int, default=8
       The number of clusters to form as well as the number of
       centroids to generate.

   init : {'k-means++', 'random'}, callable or array-like of shape (n_clusters, n_features), default='k-means++'

       Method for initialization:

       'k-means++' : selects initial cluster centers for k-mean
       clustering in a smart way to speed up convergence. See section
       Notes in k_init for more details.

       'random': choose `n_clusters` observations (rows) at random from data
       for the initial centroids.

       If an array is passed, it should be of shape (n_clusters, n_features)
       and gives the initial centers.

       If a callable is passed, it should take arguments X, n_clusters and a
       random state and return an initialization.

   n_init : int, default=10
       Number of time the k-means algorithm will be run with different
       centroid seeds. The final results will be the best output of
       n_init consecutive runs in terms of inertia.

   max_iter : int, default=300
       Maximum number of iterations of the k-means algorithm for a
       single run.

   tol : float, default=1e-4
       Relative tolerance with regards to Frobenius norm of the difference
       in the cluster centers of two consecutive iterations to declare
       convergence.

   precompute_distances : {'auto', True, False}, default='auto'
       Precompute distances (faster but takes more memory).

       'auto' : do not precompute distances if n_samples * n_clusters > 12
       million. This corresponds to about 100MB overhead per job using
       double precision. IMPORTANT: This is used only in Dask ML version.

       True : always precompute distances.

       False : never precompute distances.

   verbose : int, default=0
       Verbosity mode.

   random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
       Determines random number generation for centroid initialization. Use
       an int to make the randomness deterministic.
       See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.

   copy_x : bool, default=True
       When pre-computing distances it is more numerically accurate to center
       the data first. If copy_x is True (default), then the original data is
       not modified. If False, the original data is modified, and put back
       before the function returns, but small numerical differences may be
       introduced by subtracting and then adding the data mean. Note that if
       the original data is not C-contiguous, a copy will be made even if
       copy_x is False. If the original data is sparse, but not in CSR format,
       a copy will be made even if copy_x is False.

   n_jobs : int, default=1
       The number of OpenMP threads to use for the computation. Parallelism is
       sample-wise on the main cython loop which assigns each sample to its
       closest center. IMPORTANT: This is used only in Dask ML version.

       ``None`` or ``-1`` means using all processors.

   init_max_iter : int, default=None
       Number of iterations for init step.

   algorithm : {"auto", "full", "elkan"}, default="full"
       K-means algorithm to use. The classical EM-style algorithm is "full".
       The "elkan" variation is more efficient on data with well-defined
       clusters, by using the triangle inequality. However it's more memory
       intensive due to the allocation of an extra array of shape
       (n_samples, n_clusters).

       For now "auto" (kept for backward compatibiliy) chooses "elkan" but it
       might change in the future for a better heuristic.

       .. versionchanged:: 0.18
           Added Elkan algorithm

   oversampling_factor : int, default=2
       The amount of points to sample in scalable k-means++ initialization
       for potential centroids. Increasing this value can lead to better
       initial centroids at the cost of memory. The total number of centroids
       sampled in scalable k-means++ is oversampling_factor * n_clusters * 8.

   max_samples_per_batch : int, default=32768
       The number of data samples to use for batches of the pairwise distance
       computation. This computation is done throughout both fit predict. The
       default should suit most cases. The total number of elements in the
       batched pairwise distance computation is max_samples_per_batch *
       n_clusters. It might become necessary to lower this number when
       n_clusters becomes prohibitively large.

   output_type : {'input', 'cudf', 'cupy', 'numpy', 'numba'}, default=None
       Variable to control output type of the results and attributes of the
       estimator. If None, it'll inherit the output type set at the module
       level, cuml.global_settings.output_type. See Output Data Type
       Configuration for more info.

   See Also
   --------
   MiniBatchKMeans : Alternative online implementation that does incremental
       updates of the centers positions using mini-batches.
       For large scale learning (say n_samples > 10k) MiniBatchKMeans is
       probably much faster than the default batch implementation.

   Notes
   -----
   The k-means problem is solved using either Lloyd's or Elkan's algorithm.

   The average complexity is given by O(k n T), where n is the number of
   samples and T is the number of iteration.

   The worst case complexity is given by O(n^(k+2/p)) with
   n = n_samples, p = n_features. (D. Arthur and S. Vassilvitskii,
   'How slow is the k-means method?' SoCG2006)

   In practice, the k-means algorithm is very fast (one of the fastest
   clustering algorithms available), but it falls in local minima. That's why
   it can be useful to restart it several times.

   If the algorithm stops before fully converging (because of ``tol`` or
   ``max_iter``), ``labels_`` and ``cluster_centers_`` will not be consistent,
   i.e. the ``cluster_centers_`` will not be the means of the points in each
   cluster. Also, the estimator will reassign ``labels_`` after the last
   iteration to make ``labels_`` consistent with ``predict`` on the training
   set.

   Examples
   --------

   >>> from dasf.ml.cluster import KMeans
   >>> import numpy as np
   >>> X = np.array([[1, 2], [1, 4], [1, 0],
   ...               [10, 2], [10, 4], [10, 0]])
   >>> kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=2, random_state=0).fit(X)
   >>> kmeans.predict([[0, 0], [12, 3]])
   array([1, 0], dtype=int32)
