.. py:class:: SpectralClustering(n_clusters=8, eigen_solver=None, random_state=None, n_init=10, gamma=1.0, affinity='rbf', n_neighbors=10, eigen_tol=0.0, assign_labels='kmeans', degree=3, coef0=1, kernel_params=None, n_jobs=None, n_components=None, persist_embedding=False, kmeans_params=None, verbose=False, **kwargs)

   Bases: :py:obj:`dasf.ml.cluster.classifier.ClusterClassifier`

   Apply clustering to a projection of the normalized Laplacian.

   In practice Spectral Clustering is very useful when the structure of
   the individual clusters is highly non-convex, or more generally when
   a measure of the center and spread of the cluster is not a suitable
   description of the complete cluster, such as when clusters are
   nested circles on the 2D plane.

   If the affinity matrix is the adjacency matrix of a graph, this method
   can be used to find normalized graph cuts.

   When calling ``fit``, an affinity matrix is constructed using either
   a kernel function such the Gaussian (aka RBF) kernel with Euclidean
   distance ``d(X, X)``::

           np.exp(-gamma * d(X,X) ** 2)

   or a k-nearest neighbors connectivity matrix.

   Alternatively, a user-provided affinity matrix can be specified by
   setting ``affinity='precomputed'``.

   Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <spectral_clustering>`.

   Parameters
   ----------
   n_clusters : int, default=8
       The dimension of the projection subspace.

   eigen_solver : {'arpack', 'lobpcg', 'amg'}, default=None
       The eigenvalue decomposition strategy to use. AMG requires pyamg
       to be installed. It can be faster on very large, sparse problems,
       but may also lead to instabilities. If None, then ``'arpack'`` is
       used.

   n_components : int, default=n_clusters
       Number of eigenvectors to use for the spectral embedding

   random_state : int, RandomState instance, default=None
       A pseudo random number generator used for the initialization of the
       lobpcg eigenvectors decomposition when ``eigen_solver='amg'`` and by
       the K-Means initialization. Use an int to make the randomness
       deterministic.
       See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.

   n_init : int, default=10
       Number of time the k-means algorithm will be run with different
       centroid seeds. The final results will be the best output of n_init
       consecutive runs in terms of inertia. Only used if
       ``assign_labels='kmeans'``.

   gamma : float, default=1.0
       Kernel coefficient for rbf, poly, sigmoid, laplacian and chi2 kernels.
       Ignored for ``affinity='nearest_neighbors'``.

   affinity : str or callable, default='rbf'
       How to construct the affinity matrix.
        - 'nearest_neighbors': construct the affinity matrix by computing a
          graph of nearest neighbors.
        - 'rbf': construct the affinity matrix using a radial basis function
          (RBF) kernel.
        - 'precomputed': interpret ``X`` as a precomputed affinity matrix,
          where larger values indicate greater similarity between instances.
        - 'precomputed_nearest_neighbors': interpret ``X`` as a sparse graph
          of precomputed distances, and construct a binary affinity matrix
          from the ``n_neighbors`` nearest neighbors of each instance.
        - one of the kernels supported by
          :func:`~sklearn.metrics.pairwise_kernels`.

       Only kernels that produce similarity scores (non-negative values that
       increase with similarity) should be used. This property is not checked
       by the clustering algorithm.

   n_neighbors : int, default=10
       Number of neighbors to use when constructing the affinity matrix using
       the nearest neighbors method. Ignored for ``affinity='rbf'``.

   eigen_tol : float, default=0.0
       Stopping criterion for eigendecomposition of the Laplacian matrix
       when ``eigen_solver='arpack'``.

   assign_labels : {'kmeans', 'discretize'}, default='kmeans'
       The strategy for assigning labels in the embedding space. There are two
       ways to assign labels after the Laplacian embedding. k-means is a
       popular choice, but it can be sensitive to initialization.
       Discretization is another approach which is less sensitive to random
       initialization.

   degree : float, default=3
       Degree of the polynomial kernel. Ignored by other kernels.

   coef0 : float, default=1
       Zero coefficient for polynomial and sigmoid kernels.
       Ignored by other kernels.

   kernel_params : dict of str to any, default=None
       Parameters (keyword arguments) and values for kernel passed as
       callable object. Ignored by other kernels.

   n_jobs : int, default=None
       The number of parallel jobs to run when `affinity='nearest_neighbors'`
       or `affinity='precomputed_nearest_neighbors'`. The neighbors search
       will be done in parallel.
       ``None`` means 1 unless in a :obj:`joblib.parallel_backend` context.
       ``-1`` means using all processors. See :term:`Glossary <n_jobs>`
       for more details.

   verbose : bool, default=False
       Verbosity mode.

       .. versionadded:: 0.24

   persist_embedding : bool
       Whether to persist the intermediate n_samples x n_components array used
       for clustering.

   kmeans_params : dictionary of string to any, optional
       Keyword arguments for the KMeans clustering used for the final
       clustering.

   Examples
   --------
   >>> from dasf.ml.cluster import SpectralClustering
   >>> import numpy as np
   >>> X = np.array([[1, 1], [2, 1], [1, 0],
   ...               [4, 7], [3, 5], [3, 6]])
   >>> clustering = SpectralClustering(n_clusters=2,
   ...         assign_labels='discretize',
   ...         random_state=0).fit(X)
   >>> clustering
   SpectralClustering(assign_labels='discretize', n_clusters=2,
       random_state=0)

   Notes
   -----
   A distance matrix for which 0 indicates identical elements and high values
   indicate very dissimilar elements can be transformed into an affinity /
   similarity matrix that is well-suited for the algorithm by
   applying the Gaussian (aka RBF, heat) kernel::

       np.exp(- dist_matrix ** 2 / (2. * delta ** 2))

   where ``delta`` is a free parameter representing the width of the Gaussian
   kernel.

   An alternative is to take a symmetric version of the k-nearest neighbors
   connectivity matrix of the points.

   If the pyamg package is installed, it is used: this greatly
   speeds up computation.
