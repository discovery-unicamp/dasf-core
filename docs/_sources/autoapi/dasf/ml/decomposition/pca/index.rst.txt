   Principal component analysis (PCA).

   Linear dimensionality reduction using Singular Value Decomposition of the
   data to project it to a lower dimensional space. The input data is centered
   but not scaled for each feature before applying the SVD.

   It uses the LAPACK implementation of the full SVD or a randomized truncated
   SVD by the method of Halko et al. 2009, depending on the shape of the input
   data and the number of components to extract.

   With sparse inputs, the ARPACK implementation of the truncated SVD can be
   used (i.e. through :func:`scipy.sparse.linalg.svds`). Alternatively, one
   may consider :class:`TruncatedSVD` where the data are not centered.

   Notice that this class only supports sparse inputs for some solvers such as
   "arpack" and "covariance_eigh". See :class:`TruncatedSVD` for an
   alternative with sparse data.

   For a usage example, see
   :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_decomposition_plot_pca_iris.py`

   Read more in the :ref:`User Guide <PCA>`.

   Parameters
   ----------
   n_components : int, float or 'mle', default=None
       Number of components to keep.
       if n_components is not set all components are kept::

           n_components == min(n_samples, n_features)

       If ``n_components == 'mle'`` and ``svd_solver == 'full'``, Minka's
       MLE is used to guess the dimension. Use of ``n_components == 'mle'``
       will interpret ``svd_solver == 'auto'`` as ``svd_solver == 'full'``.

       If ``0 < n_components < 1`` and ``svd_solver == 'full'``, select the
       number of components such that the amount of variance that needs to be
       explained is greater than the percentage specified by n_components.

       If ``svd_solver == 'arpack'``, the number of components must be
       strictly less than the minimum of n_features and n_samples.

       Hence, the None case results in::

           n_components == min(n_samples, n_features) - 1

   copy : bool, default=True
       If False, data passed to fit are overwritten and running
       fit(X).transform(X) will not yield the expected results,
       use fit_transform(X) instead.

   whiten : bool, default=False
       When True (False by default) the `components_` vectors are multiplied
       by the square root of n_samples and then divided by the singular values
       to ensure uncorrelated outputs with unit component-wise variances.

       Whitening will remove some information from the transformed signal
       (the relative variance scales of the components) but can sometime
       improve the predictive accuracy of the downstream estimators by
       making their data respect some hard-wired assumptions.

   svd_solver : {'auto', 'full', 'covariance_eigh', 'arpack', 'randomized'},            default='auto'
       "auto" :
           The solver is selected by a default 'auto' policy is based on `X.shape` and
           `n_components`: if the input data has fewer than 1000 features and
           more than 10 times as many samples, then the "covariance_eigh"
           solver is used. Otherwise, if the input data is larger than 500x500
           and the number of components to extract is lower than 80% of the
           smallest dimension of the data, then the more efficient
           "randomized" method is selected. Otherwise the exact "full" SVD is
           computed and optionally truncated afterwards.
       "full" :
           Run exact full SVD calling the standard LAPACK solver via
           `scipy.linalg.svd` and select the components by postprocessing
       "covariance_eigh" :
           Precompute the covariance matrix (on centered data), run a
           classical eigenvalue decomposition on the covariance matrix
           typically using LAPACK and select the components by postprocessing.
           This solver is very efficient for n_samples >> n_features and small
           n_features. It is, however, not tractable otherwise for large
           n_features (large memory footprint required to materialize the
           covariance matrix). Also note that compared to the "full" solver,
           this solver effectively doubles the condition number and is
           therefore less numerical stable (e.g. on input data with a large
           range of singular values).
       "arpack" :
           Run SVD truncated to `n_components` calling ARPACK solver via
           `scipy.sparse.linalg.svds`. It requires strictly
           `0 < n_components < min(X.shape)`
       "randomized" :
           Run randomized SVD by the method of Halko et al.

       maximum variance in the data. Equivalently, the right singular
       vectors of the centered input data, parallel to its eigenvectors.
       The components are sorted by decreasing ``explained_variance_``.

   explained_variance_ : ndarray of shape (n_components,)
       The amount of variance explained by each of the selected components.
       The variance estimation uses `n_samples - 1` degrees of freedom.

       sum of the ratios is equal to 1.0.

   singular_values_ : ndarray of shape (n_components,)
       The singular values corresponding to each of the selected components.
       The singular values are equal to the 2-norms of the ``n_components``
