   .. versionadded:: 0.18

   Parameters
   ----------
   n_components : int, default=1
       The number of mixture components.

   covariance_type : {'full', 'tied', 'diag', 'spherical'}, default='full'
       String describing the type of covariance parameters to use.
       Must be one of:

       - 'full': each component has its own general covariance matrix.
       - 'tied': all components share the same general covariance matrix.
       - 'diag': each component has its own diagonal covariance matrix.
       - 'spherical': each component has its own single variance.

   tol : float, default=1e-3
       The convergence threshold. EM iterations will stop when the
       lower bound average gain is below this threshold.

   reg_covar : float, default=1e-6
       Non-negative regularization added to the diagonal of covariance.
       Allows to assure that the covariance matrices are all positive.

   max_iter : int, default=100
       The number of EM iterations to perform.

   n_init : int, default=1
       The number of initializations to perform. The best results are kept.

   init_params : {'kmeans', 'k-means++', 'random', 'random_from_data'},     default='kmeans'
       The method used to initialize the weights, the means and the
       precisions.
       String must be one of:

       - 'kmeans' : responsibilities are initialized using kmeans.
       - 'k-means++' : use the k-means++ method to initialize.
       - 'random' : responsibilities are initialized randomly.
       - 'random_from_data' : initial means are randomly selected data points.

       .. versionchanged:: v1.1
           `init_params` now accepts 'random_from_data' and 'k-means++' as
           initialization methods.

   weights_init : array-like of shape (n_components, ), default=None
       The user-provided initial weights.
       If it is None, weights are initialized using the `init_params` method.

   means_init : array-like of shape (n_components, n_features), default=None
       The user-provided initial means,
       If it is None, means are initialized using the `init_params` method.

   precisions_init : array-like, default=None
       The user-provided initial precisions (inverse of the covariance
       matrices).
       If it is None, precisions are initialized using the 'init_params'
       method.
       The shape depends on 'covariance_type'::

           (n_components,)                        if 'spherical',
           (n_features, n_features)               if 'tied',
           (n_components, n_features)             if 'diag',
           (n_components, n_features, n_features) if 'full'

   random_state : int, RandomState instance or None, default=None
       Controls the random seed given to the method chosen to initialize the
       parameters (see `init_params`).
       In addition, it controls the generation of random samples from the
       fitted distribution (see the method `sample`).
       Pass an int for reproducible output across multiple function calls.
       See :term:`Glossary <random_state>`.

   warm_start : bool, default=False
       If 'warm_start' is True, the solution of the last fitting is used as
       initialization for the next call of fit(). This can speed up
       convergence when fit is called several times on similar problems.
       In that case, 'n_init' is ignored and only a single initialization
       occurs upon the first call.
       See :term:`the Glossary <warm_start>`.

   verbose : int, default=0
       Enable verbose output. If 1 then it prints the current
       initialization and each iteration step. If greater than 1 then
       it prints also the log probability and the time needed
       for each step.

   verbose_interval : int, default=10
       Number of iteration done before the next print.

   Attributes
   ----------
   weights_ : array-like of shape (n_components,)
       The weights of each mixture components.

   means_ : array-like of shape (n_components, n_features)
       The mean of each mixture component.

   covariances_ : array-like
       The covariance of each mixture component.
       The shape depends on `covariance_type`::

           (n_components,)                        if 'spherical',
           (n_features, n_features)               if 'tied',
           (n_components, n_features)             if 'diag',
           (n_components, n_features, n_features) if 'full'

   precisions_ : array-like
       The precision matrices for each component in the mixture. A precision
       matrix is the inverse of a covariance matrix. A covariance matrix is
       symmetric positive definite so the mixture of Gaussian can be
       equivalently parameterized by the precision matrices. Storing the
       precision matrices instead of the covariance matrices makes it more
       efficient to compute the log-likelihood of new samples at test time.
       The shape depends on `covariance_type`::

           (n_components,)                        if 'spherical',
           (n_features, n_features)               if 'tied',
           (n_components, n_features)             if 'diag',
           (n_components, n_features, n_features) if 'full'

   precisions_cholesky_ : array-like
       The cholesky decomposition of the precision matrices of each mixture
       component. A precision matrix is the inverse of a covariance matrix.
       A covariance matrix is symmetric positive definite so the mixture of
       Gaussian can be equivalently parameterized by the precision matrices.
       Storing the precision matrices instead of the covariance matrices makes
       it more efficient to compute the log-likelihood of new samples at test
       time. The shape depends on `covariance_type`::

           (n_components,)                        if 'spherical',
           (n_features, n_features)               if 'tied',
           (n_components, n_features)             if 'diag',
           (n_components, n_features, n_features) if 'full'

   converged_ : bool
       True when convergence of the best fit of EM was reached, False otherwise.

   n_iter_ : int
       Number of step used by the best fit of EM to reach the convergence.

   lower_bound_ : float
       Lower bound value on the log-likelihood (of the training data with
       respect to the model) of the best fit of EM.

   n_features_in_ : int
       Number of features seen during :term:`fit`.

       .. versionadded:: 0.24

   feature_names_in_ : ndarray of shape (`n_features_in_`,)
       Names of features seen during :term:`fit`. Defined only when `X`
       has feature names that are all strings.

   .. py:attribute:: __gmm_cpu


   .. py:method:: _fit_cpu(X, y=None)

      Estimate Gaussian Mixture model parameters with the EM algorithm using
      CPU only.

      The method fits the model ``n_init`` times and sets the parameters with
      which the model has the largest likelihood or lower bound. Within each
      trial, the method iterates between E-step and M-step for ``max_iter``
      times until the change of likelihood or lower bound is less than
      ``tol``, otherwise, a ``ConvergenceWarning`` is raised.
      If ``warm_start`` is ``True``, then ``n_init`` is ignored and a single
      initialization is performed upon the first call. Upon consecutive
      calls, training starts where it left off.

      Parameters
      ----------
      X : array-like of shape (n_samples, n_features)
          List of n_features-dimensional data points. Each row
          corresponds to a single data point.

      y : Ignored
          Not used, present for API consistency by convention.

      Returns
      -------
      self : object
          The fitted mixture.



   .. py:method:: _fit_predict_cpu(X, y=None)

      Estimate model parameters using X and predict the labels for X using
      CPU only.

      The method fits the model n_init times and sets the parameters with
      which the model has the largest likelihood or lower bound. Within each
      trial, the method iterates between E-step and M-step for `max_iter`
      times until the change of likelihood or lower bound is less than
      `tol`, otherwise, a :class:`~sklearn.exceptions.ConvergenceWarning` is
      raised. After fitting, it predicts the most probable label for the
      input data points.

      .. versionadded:: 0.20

      Parameters
      ----------
      X : array-like of shape (n_samples, n_features)

      -------
      labels : array, shape (n_samples,)
          Component labels.



   .. py:method:: _predict_cpu(X, y=None)

      Predict the labels for the data samples in X using trained model using

      Parameters

   .. py:method:: _set_params_cpu(**params)

      The method works on simple estimators as well as on nested objects.
      The latter have parameters of the form ``<component>__<parameter>``
      so that it's possible to update each component of a nested object.
